<h3>Why Adventures in a Snap?</h3>
This project is built in an attempt to increase public intrest in the art of photography.
My goal is to create an environment where people who have any intrest in photography can
get together and learn some new skills all while having fun.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
- MERN stack
- passportJS: authenticate with google (will possibly add more login solutions later)
- mongoose: easy interaction with mongoDB (started out with mongodb package instead but made the switch to mongoose)

<h3>Upcoming Updates</h3>

- event api will receive an argument allowing retrieval based on dates.
- post route to create events.
- connect api to db.
- create instructor flag on instructor accounts in db.
- allow instructors special privileges for editing events.
